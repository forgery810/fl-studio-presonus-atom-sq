# Presonus Atom SQ MIDI Script for FL Studio 

A python MIDI-script to increase the functionality of the Presonus Atom SQ with FL Studio. This script adds a step-sequencer, random step and random note generator, mixer, channel, and plugin control, etc.
 
# Step Selector Added 0.7.5

A new layout has neem added that allows jumping to steps during playback in the Channel Rack. It is difficult to time correctly and may not make the cut but it is worth try if you want to experiment with playback.

The Graph window for step parameter editing now appear when parameters are edited. Turning knob 8 will make the window go away.


# Pattern Shifting Mode Added 0.7.1

A new experimental mode has been added that can apply bit-shifting to selected patterns. It can be reached by pressing the E button until the steps are light blue and the hint messages reads "Alter". Knob 5 can be used to select between shifting left, right, inverting or clearing (of shifting) the highlighted channel. The functionality is dependent on channel position in the Channel Rack. As a result, if you delete a channel or move channels to a group, a different channel's pattern will be altered.

# Development Branch

This is the development branch for the script which will be updated much more frequently. This will allow users to try new functionality as it is coded, with the added risk of bugs. There may be changes in layout or functionality that may not make it to the final version. 

Please email me or create an issue on Github if you find any problems. 

The User Manual will not be updated until the dev branch is moved to main. Check the version_info.txt for information about changes made in the dev branch.
