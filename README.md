   # Bugs

While the up and down arrows work, they have a quirk where the will go the right direction and then every fifth push or so go the wrong direction for one push. It can still get you to your destination though.  

Fixed -> In Pad per Channel mode, recorded notes last until end of pattern. (This has been fixed in 0.01.05)
