# Presonus Atom SQ MIDI Script for FL Studio

A python MIDI-script to increase the functionality of the Presonus Atom SQ with FL Studio. This script adds a step-sequencer, random step and random note generator, mixer, channel, and plugin control, etc.

# Navigation Changed

Now instead of the B button rotating through different sub modes, the plus/minus buttons are used. Tapping the buttons can result in double entries/skipping selections, so I recommend pushing them a little more carefully. 

# Continuous Mode Updated

Continuous note mode finally has scales added. Root notes can be selected by pushing the plus button and scales with the minus button.

# New Mode Added

A new mode has been added called Accumulator. It allows individual steps to increase or decrease their note value each time it is played a set number of times. See the manual for a description of how it works.


See installation and manual pdfs for more information.
