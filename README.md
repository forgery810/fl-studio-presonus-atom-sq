# Presonus Atom SQ MIDI Script for FL Studio 

A python MIDI-script to increase the functionality of the Presonus Atom SQ with FL Studio. This script adds a step-sequencer, random step and random note generator, mixer, channel, and plugin control, etc.

# Development Branch

This is the development branch for the script which will be updated much more frequently. This will allow users to try new functionality as it is coded, with the added risk of bugs. Please email me or create an issue on Github if you find any problems. 

The User Manual will not be updated until the dev branch is moved to main. Check the version_info.txt for information about changes made in the dev branch.
