# Presonus Atom SQ MIDI Script for FL Studio 

A python MIDI-script to increase the functionality of the Presonus Atom SQ with FL Studio. This script adds a step-sequencer, random step and random note generator, mixer, channel, and plugin control, etc.

# New Mode Added - Shifter

A new experimental mode has been added that can apply bit-shifting to selected patterns. It can be reached by pressing the E button until the steps are light blue and the hint messages reads "Alter". Knob 5 can be used to select between shifting left, right, inverting or clearing (of shifting) the highlighted channel. The functionality is dependent on channel position in the Channel Rack. As a result, if you delete a channel or move channels to a group, a different channel's pattern will be altered.

# Copy/Paste Options Added
The B button rotates through copy pattern/copy channel/paste options that the A button enacts. 

# Development Branch Added

This is a new branch that will be updated more frequently. It will have new functionality that the main branch does not but be more prone to errors.
